# Tic Tac Toe
This assignment is coded by Harmeet Singh, Ethan Davidson, Janeen Soria, and John O'Hare for our Software Engineering course, and it is based on the game Tic Tac Toe, which can be fully explained here: https://www.exploratorium.edu/brain_explorer/tictactoe.html

## Our Process
###### System Functionality
- This project is coded in Python because this project is based on Harmeet and Ethan's project 1, which was in Python. Their previous project is the code base of this project. We used Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook to write and run the code.
- We built off of all of the code base, which was 318 lines of code and 10 methods in 1 file. In this project, there are //TODO write the number of lines of code, methods, and files when the project is done

###### How to Run the Code
- The files can be ran by having all python files in one location and running the player.py file in a python ide.


###### Our Approach
- The board
  - We considered using JavaFX since we were all familiar with Java. However, after having some difficulty using it, we decided to build off of Harmeet and Ethan's Project 1 instead since they already had a GUI for the board.
- Separate files
  - The previous project was all in one file, and we decided to separate the code into methods and separate files so the tasks were easier to split among group members. There is the Board file where it contains the GUI and the methods, and then the Player file where it allows users to enter player names and decide if there is a win or a draw.
